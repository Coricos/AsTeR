                <p class="lead" >Aster is an open source project that was started by UC Berkeley students on
                    April 27th 2019. During the IBM Call for Code hackathon at UC Berkeley, we decided to build a disaster
                    manager platform to dispatch the right resources at the right time given as many inputs as there
                    are available. </p>
                    <p class="lead">Forest fires are frequent in California and natural disasters rise in intensity
                    due to climate change. Ageing technologies used in unit dispatching struggle to keep the pace and
                    do not allow efficient over-time monitoring and scalability. This is the context in which Aster
                    was born.</p>
                <h1 class="cover-heading" align="center">Our Story</h1>
                <p class="lead"> We are a group of passionnate engineers who began to work together at UC Berkeley. The different 
                backgrounds of our team give us the ability to find helpful and powerful ideas to develop. We know what itâ€™s like 
                to have epic enthusiasm and inspiration for a tech concept and we are extremely pleased to bring it to life. From
                our different paths, it's always enjoyable to work as a team and share the talent and the skills with a significant
                purpose.</p>
                <p class="lead">What gives us the will to work on this project? We were all chocked by the enormous fires in Califonia
                in 2018 and by the hurricane Irma in 2017. When you see these natural disasters, as young engineers, we wanted to be able
                to help the victims, the emergency services and all persons impacted by these catastrophes. The IBM Call for Code hackathon
                has been the perfect place to brainstrom and implement our idea of dispatching platform. Building a impactful and meaningful
                solution to help emergency services reflects exactly our way of thinking today and what we want to accomplish tomorrow.
