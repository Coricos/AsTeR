2019 - IBM Call for Code hackathon, building a disaster manager platform, dispatching the right resources at the right time given the input of the people on the field.

Building a resource dispacher using AI analyzed emergency calls during a natural disaster.

We take the example of the city of San Francisco and simulate the dispatch of forces on the field. We vizualize the shorter route for the emergency forces to go directly on the ground.
